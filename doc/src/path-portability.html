<h2><a name="Differences-Boost">Differences from Boost Filesystem</a></h2>


<p>In the Boost library, class <code>path</code> solves portability needs via facilities to handle narrow 
(i.e. <code>char</code>) character strings with encodings other than the 
operating system's native encoding. That caused unfortunate interface clutter, 
so the Library Working Group asked that the clutter be removed from class <code>path</code>. Instead, proposal
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2012/n3398.html">N3398, String Interoperation Library</a>, 
provides general facilities that handle some use 
cases and some helper functions have been added to the Filesystem Library.</p>


<p>Otherwise, the proposal is very similar to the Boost library. Indeed, 
the proposed wording is generated from the same source as the Boost library's 
reference documentation.</p>


<h2><a name="Path-portability">Path portability</a></h2>

<p>Moving code from a tidy environment where narrow character strings are always 
UTF-8 encoded to an environment where the narrow character encoding differs 
can be a daunting experience.&nbsp; Filenames can become unrecognizable to a 
human or to a file system. The same problem also applies to other encodings, 
although UTF-8 is so ubiquitous it deserves special consideration.</p>

<p>One of the design objectives of the Filesystem Library is to ease this 
problem. The solution centers around the constructors for class <code>path</code>:</p>

character strings</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Narrow (i.e. <code>char</code>) character strings that contain 
anything other than 7-bit ASCII characters are inherently non-portable for 
creating and observing paths, because the encoding of narrow strings is system 
dependent.</p>
    <ul>
      <li dir="ltr">Do not use <code>char</code> string literals (<code>&quot;an&quot;</code>) 
      to create a <code>path</code> unless the literal is composed 
      entirely of 7-bit ASCII characters.<br>
      <br>
      Instead, use <code>char32_t</code> string literals (<code>U&quot;äñ𠃰&quot;</code>), 
      as these are always safe.<br>
      <br>
      It is also OK to use <code>char16_t</code> string 
      literals (<code>u&quot;äñ&quot;</code>) if all characters are within the 
      16-bit Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) and there is no issue with 
      combining characters, but non-experts can ignore this approach.<br>
